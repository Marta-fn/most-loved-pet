# Pawfect Match: A Pet Adoption Website

For the SheCodes Most-Loved Pet Challenge, I created 'Pawfect Match' using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS to develop my skills. This responsive website is designed to provide a seamless user experience across all devices.

Includes:

• Adopt a Pet Section: Displays pictures, ages, and fun facts about the pets available for adoption.

• Success Stories: Showcases client feedback and heartwarming adoption stories.

• Contact Us Section: Provides an easy way for users to get in touch with the adoption center.

The data is fictional and serves demonstration purposes, simulating a real-life pet adoption center.
